            <p>BTS is an acronym for Bangtan Sonyeondan, which in English translates to bulletproof boyscouts. The name means that they will fight against the 
                societal “bullets” of stereotypes and repression to protect their values and music. They debuted on June 13, 2013 but did not get full popularity
                unitl they performed at the 2017 American Music Awards. The genre of music they make is mostly a mix of rap and pop, but they dip their toes into R&B,
                EDM, and rock occasionally.</p>
                <p>At the Permission to Dance On Stage press conference in 2021, RM said: “100% is our success and 50% belongs to ARMY, 35% belongs 
                to us and 15% belongs to the company. I am only 5%. You realize you're just a piece of success, you didn't do it alone and it helps 
                you keep your feet on the ground.”</p>
                <p>BTS did not get to this level of fame overnight, or was it an easy path. They all lived in a one bedroom apartment, got cut from broadcasts, 
                and was not really accepted into the western media until recently. They all work extremely hard to perfect their craft, all while having masters
                degrees. </p>
                <p>ARMY is the name of the fans. The name was created July 9, 2013 and is an acronym that stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth. (no one likes to
                use that anymore, its too cringey!) ARMY is known to be very protective of BTS, as they are the target for racism and xenophobia. In 2020, BTS donated 
                1 million dollars towards the Black Lives Matter fund, and ARMY matched the donation in less than 24 hours. BTS is also just as protective with ARMY. They
                have released multiple free songs for each of their birthdays, as gifts or ways to say thank you for the support. Whenever they win an award, ARMY is aways 
                the first person that gets thanked in their speeches.</p>
