            <h1 id="info">About My Site</h1>
            <p>I chose to do my site about them since most people don't really know who they are, besides the news articles about them causing stock boosts and crashes
                for the South Korea economy. I used to dance, and for a long time that was a huge part of my life. I got hurt, and I had to stop. One day, I randomly was
                searching endlessly on youtube, as one does, and found one of BTS' dance practices. I was in total awe. I then got into their music, and it took me out of a
                really dark place that I was in. No matter what genre of music you like, they have something that you can bop your head to. I then started to learn about who they 
                were, and how relatable they were. Hopefully, this site can give you a new look into who BTS are.</p>

            <p>BTS is one of the many things my family bond over, and my mom and I actually had the chance to go to one of their concerts, but COVID-19 hit, and it got canceled. We also got
                matching tattoos of their album covers.</p>
