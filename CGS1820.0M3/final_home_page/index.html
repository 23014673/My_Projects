            <p>BTS is one of the many things my family bond over, and my mom and I actually had the chance to go to one of their concerts, but COVID-19 hit, and it got canceled. We also got
                matching tattoos of their album covers.</p>
            <p>I chose to do my site about them since most people don't really know who they are, besides the news articles about them causing stock boosts/crashes
                for the South Korea economy. I used to dance, and for a long time that was a huge part of my life. I got hurt, and I had to stop. One day, I randomly was
                searching endlessly on youtube, as one does, and found one of BTS' dance practices. I was in total awe. I then got into their music, and it took me out of a
                really dark place that I was in. No matter what genre of music you like, they have something that you can bop your head to. I then started to learn about who they 
                were, and how relatable they were. Hopefully, this site can give you a new look into who BTS are.</p>
