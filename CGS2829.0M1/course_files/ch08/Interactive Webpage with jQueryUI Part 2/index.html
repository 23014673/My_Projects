                        <p>American folk music has many different genres including gospel, olde tyme music, jug bands, bluegrass, blues, Appalachian folk and many others. Folk music traces its 
                            roots back to the British Isles, mainland Europe, and Africa. Folk music is the ancestor of rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and jazz. We're not Elvis or B.B. King, 
                            but their music is built on top of ours. We're not cool or hip, but we are inspirational! Come on in and sit a spell and let me tell you all about folk music instruments. 
                            Click on the panels below and I'll tell you about that instrument.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/accordion.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Image of an Accordion" title="image of an Accordion" class="instrument-image"><strong>Accordions</strong> 
                            (from 19th-century German Akkordeon, from Akkord—"musical chord, concord of sounds") are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone 
                            type, colloquially referred to as a squeezebox. A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist. The concertina and bandoneón are related; the harmonium and American 
                            reed organ are in the same family. The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys, causing pallets to open, which allow air to 
                            flow across strips of brass or steel, called reeds. These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument \'s 
                            reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block. The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual, and the accompaniment, consisting 
                            of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/mandolin.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Image of a mandolin" title="image of a mandolin" class="instrument-image">A <strong>mandolin</strong> (Italian: mandolino 
                            pronounced [mandoˈliːno]; literally "small mandola") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or "pick". It commonly has four courses of 
                            doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect 
                            fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. There are many styles of mandolin, but three are common, the Neapolitan 
                            or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top 
                            or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for 
                            strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/dulcimer.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Image of dulcimer" title="Image of dulcimer" class="instrument-image">The <strong>Appalachian dulcimer</strong> (many variant names; 
                            see below) is a fretted string instrument of the zither family, typically with three or four strings. Its origins are in the Appalachian region of the United States. The body extends the length 
                            of the fingerboard, and its fretting is generally diatonic. The Appalachian dulcimer has many variant names. Most often it is simply called a dulcimer (also rendered as "dulcimore", "dulcymore", 
                            "delcimer", "delcimore", et al.). When it needs to be distinguished from the unrelated Hammered dulcimer, various adjectives are added (drawn from location, playing style, position, shape, etc.), 
                            for example: mountain dulcimer; Kentucky dulcimer; plucked dulcimer; fretted dulcimer; lap dulcimer; teardrop dulcimer; box dulcimer; etc. The instrument has also acquired a number of nicknames 
                            (some shared by other instruments): "harmonium," "hog fiddle," "music box," "harmony box," and "mountain zither". Although the Appalachian dulcimer first appeared in the early 19th century among 
                            Scotch-Irish immigrant communities in the Appalachian Mountains, the instrument has no known precedent in Ireland or Scotland. Because of this, and a dearth of written records, the history of the 
                            Appalachian dulcimer has been, until fairly recently, largely speculative.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/banjo.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Image of Banjo" title="image of Banjo" class="instrument-image">The <strong>Banjo</strong> is a four-, five- or six-stringed instrument with 
                            a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity as a resonator, called the head. The membrane, or head, is typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and 
                            the frame is typically circular. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design. The banjo is frequently associated with country, 
                            folk, Irish traditional and bluegrass music. Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in African American traditional music, before becoming popular in the minstrel shows of the 19th century. The 
                            banjo, with the fiddle, is a mainstay of American old-time music. It is also very frequently used in Traditional ("Trad") Jazz.There are several theories concerning the origin of the name banjo. It could 
                            have come from the Yoruba word Bami jo, which means "dance for me." It may derive from the Kimbundu word mbanza. Some etymologists believe it comes from a dialectal pronunciation of the Portuguese "bandore" 
                            or from an early anglicisation of the Spanish word bandurria, though other research suggests that it may come from a West African term for a bamboo stick formerly used for the instrument's neck.</p>
