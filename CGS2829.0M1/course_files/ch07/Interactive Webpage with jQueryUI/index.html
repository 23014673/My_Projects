                    <p> My favorite thing of the year that I got to do was when I last minute got to go to Global Citizen Live in NYC Times Square. One of my friends goes to school at NYU and won 
                        2 VIP tickets! She knows I am a huge fan of BTS (one of the members headlined), so she offered me the second ticket. All I had to do was get a cheap flight and I was there right away!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> "Global Citizen is a movement on a mission to end extreme poverty with the 2023 Global Citizen Festival campaign taking aim at the major issues driving extreme poverty, 
                        including the climate crisis, gender inequity, food insecurity, and more.In 2021, BTS performed from Seoul as part of Global Citizen Live which featured 65 artists performing 
                        across 6 continents to call for urgent action to defeat poverty and protect the planet. At the 2023 Global Citizen Festival, Jung Kook performed solo on the Great Lawn of 
                        Central Park! He joined Global Citizen to call for action to help end extreme poverty."</p>

            <h2>Athens, Greece | Acropolis</h2>

            <div class="flexbox-container">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p> My favorite museum of the year that I went to was the Acropolis at the Parthenon. Seeing pieces of art that are older than some civilizations was eye opening. The art piere 
                        I chose to show is called the 'Caryatids: The Daughters of Athens'. Sadly there is one sister missing, as it was taken by the British and never given back. The lost
                        sister now sits alone in the Biritsh Museaum with thousands of other stolen art pieces. The Acropolis Museum purposely leaves a space for her to return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> "The Acropolis of Athens and its monuments are universal symbols of the classical spirit and civilization and form the greatest architectural and artistic complex 
                        bequeathed by Greek Antiquity to the world." </p>

            <h2>Paris, France | Lourve</h2>

            <div class="flexbox-container">
                <div class="image-content">
                    <img src="images/image3.png" alt="Global Citizen Live Image 1" style="width: 400px; height: 455px;">
                </div>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p> My favorite city of the year was Paris, France. I was only there for 3 days but I got to go to a lot of places like Disney Paris, most of the famous monuments, and the Lourve! I didn't take 
                        a ton of photos, as I was trying to just "live in the moment" but these two art pieces are the most famous.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mona Lisa - "The Mona Lisa’s special allure has brought her all sorts of unwelcome attention too, with incidents that have only added to her celebrity status. In 1911, for example, an Italian 
                        museum worker stole the painting ‘to return it to its homeland’, sparking a furore in the press!"</p>
                    <p>Liberty Leading the People - "Delacroix deliberately used the colours blue, white and red in combination several times in his painting: the French flag, a symbol of the 1789 Revolution then of the Empire, was banned 
                        when the Monarchy returned to power between 1815 and 1830. This famous allegorical/historical painting, often referenced in art and advertising, stands as a symbol of liberty and freedom fights."</p>
