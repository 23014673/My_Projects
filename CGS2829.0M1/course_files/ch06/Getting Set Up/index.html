            <h2>Orlando</h2>
            <p>Orlando has more than 100 lakes. Lake Eola is a sinkhole that is 80 feet deep.</p>
            <p>Orlando was the main hub of Florida's citrus industry. A deep freeze in the late 1800s caused farmers to move their citrus crops further south.</p>
            <p>The city was originally named Jernigan, after the first permanent settler in the area. Orlando may have been renamed for a character in Shakespeare's &quot;As You Like It&quot;</p>
            <p>The Rogers Building and the Railroad Depot are the oldest building remaining in downtown Orlando.</p>
            <p>66 million people visited Orlando in 2015 and Orlando is the #1 tourist city in the world. The number of daily visitors to Orlando is the size of the population of Atlanta.</p>
            <p>Gatorland is a theme park that was opened in 1949. Its main attraction was a 15-foot gator (a world record).</p>
            <p>Universal Studios opened in Orlando in 1990 with Nickelodeon, Back to the Future, E.T. Ghostbusters, and the Bates Hotel as attractions.</p>
            <p>The old city hall was blown up as part of the opening scene of Lethal Weapon 3.</p>
            <p>The official nickname of Orlando is &quot;The City Beautiful&quot;. It is also known as &quot;O-Town&quot;.</p>
            <p>The Orlando Magic (NBA team) almost became the Orlando Juice. The finalist names were the Heat, the Tropics, the Juice, and the Magic.</p>
